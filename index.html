		<p>Unify was a hackathon at Spotify's Stockholm offices, arranged by Spotify Street Team KTH. It was held on the weekend of May 16th-17th.</p>
		<h1>And what a weekend it was</h1>
		<p>The participants where split into 4 teams of 8-9, all teams working on the same area (Travel+Music), but assigned to different platforms.</p>

		<p>To begin with, we used a lot of what we learned from <a href="http://diversify.github.io">Diversify</a> to get as diverse a crowd as possible. After that, it was mostly a question of setting up an atmosphere that encouraged learning, and we really think we succeeded. Much was learned, and figurative bridges were built as well as literal ones.</p>
		<p>The teams built some really awesome things, and so, without further ado, here are their projects:</p>

		<h2>Team Android presents Jamspot</h2>
		<p>Team Android created the app Jamspot! Jamspot is both an Android application and a physical map with NFC tags. When you scan a certain country the app plays a playlist that is connected to that country. Perfect for those who want to discover a country through music. The map could be situated at a travel agency for exploration and inspiration or maybe at home for recalling nice memories from a trip.</p>

		<h2>Team Netscape presents Venew</h2>
		<p>Venew allows the user to enter a location and a time span for which the user is willing to travel. Venew will then show the user what concerts and music festivals are available over that time span. The user can drag the slider to just show a specific weekend or period. A playlist with the most popular songs of the artists in the time period can be generated using the Spotify API.</p>

		<p>Triptunes is a webapplication that generates playlists for cities in the world you are traveling to.
